Notes on the textbook:

    A Mathematical Introduction to Robotic Manipulation
    Richard M. Murray and Zexiang Li and S. Shankar Sastry


***************************
* Chapter 1: Introduction *

Some history here ... not that relevant to me at this moment. I'd like to see a
more modern take on this.

But I do like this:

> The vast majority of robots in operation today consist of six joints which are
> either rotary (articulated) or sliding (prismatic), with a simple "end-
> effector" for interacting with the workpieces.

Yes, the dvrk has one "prismatic" joint out of seven (note, seven, not six...)
and the others are rotary --- the dvrk guide actually says "revolute". And I
obviously know the end-effectors by now.

Then they talk about the book outline. Yeah, maybe I'll definitely take a look
at Chapter 2 at a "leisurely pace" to better understand rigid body motion:

> In this chapter, we present a geometric view to understanding translational
> and rotational motion of a rigid body. While this is one of the most
> ubiquitous topics encountered in textbooks on mechanics and robotics, it is
> also perhaps one of the most frequently misunderstood.

OK, fair enough.
