    Modern Robotics: Mechanics, Planning, and Control, 2017

It's looks very similar to Murray, Li, and Sastry's book.

One way of categorizing robots:

- Open chain: all joints are "actuated," i.e., that we can move them. Example:
  most industrial robotic arm manipulators.
- Closed chain: only some joints are "actuated." Example: Stewart-Gough
  Platform (!!)

The following joints have one degree of freedom, for rotation and translation,
respectively.

- Revolute joints: these allow for rotation about the joint axis.
- Prismatic joints: these allow for linear translation along the joint axis.

Use "Degrees of Freedom" to specify the number of "actuated joints." However, a
(potentially better) sense of DoF is the notion of **configuration spaces**:

> A more abstract but equivalent definition of the degrees of freedom of a robot
> begins with the notion of its configuration space: a robot's configuration is
> a complete specification of the positions and orientations of each link of a
> robot, and its configuration space is the set of all possible configurations
> of the robot.

Studies the problem of: given a set of input joint values, find the output
position and orientation of the reference frame attached to the end-effector.
This is easily done for an open-chain robot, and the default solution is the
"Product of Exponentials" (PoE) formula.
