CS 61C Lecture Review
Fall 2017 Semester

**********************************
* Lecture 1: Course Introduction *
* Given: August 24, 2017         *
**********************************

Lecture is about four things, well, three that matter to me: (1) machine
structures, (2) great ideas (in architecture), and (3) how everything is just a
number.


Machine Structures

    C is the most popular programming language, followed by Python. Use C to
    write software for speed/performance, e.g. embedded systems. EDIT: nope!
    That was in F-2016. Now in F-2017, Python has taken over, probably due to
    Deep Learning. But C is still in second place.

    This class isn't about C programming, but C is a VERY important language to
    know in order to understand the important stuff: the **hardware-software
    interface**. It's closer to the hardware than Java or Python.

    Things we'll learn on the software side:
        Parallel requests 
        Parallel threads
        Parallel instructions
        Parallel data
        Hardware descriptions

    and the hardware side:
        Logic gates
        Main memory
        Cores
        Caches
        Instruction Units

    Looks like the "new version/face" of CS 61C is parallelism, as I should know
    from CS 267. Along with computers being on **mobile devices** and in many
    other areas, such as cars! So many things have computers and sensors in them
    nowadays, that it's mind-blowing.


Great Ideas in Architecture

    Abstraction (Phil Guo's one-word description of CS)

        Anything can be represented as a number.  But does this mean we WANT
        them to be like that?  No, we want to program in a "high-level" like C
        so that we don't have to trudge through assembly language code.

        We follow this hierarchy: 
            ==> C
            ==> compiler
            ==> assembly language (then machine language??)
            ==> machine interpretation (note, in F-2017 they're doing RISC-V,
                not MIPS, which I think was in S-2017 ...)
            ==> architecture implementation (the logic circuit diagram?)
            (I don't fully understand assembly/architecture parts)

    Moore's Law (is it still applicable?!?)

        Basic idea: every 2 years (sometimes I've seen it 1.5 years ...) the
        number of transistors per chip will double. Transistors are the basic
        source of computation in computers, they're the bits of electricity that
        turn into 0s and 1s. From Wikipedia: 
            "A transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify or switch
            electronic signals and electrical power. It is composed of
            semiconductor material usually with at least three terminals for
            connection to an external circuit. A voltage or current applied to
            one pair of the transistor's terminals controls the current through
            another pair of terminals. Because the controlled (output) power can
            be higher than the controlling (input) power, a transistor can
            amplify a signal", 
        and 
            "The transistor is the fundamental building block of modern
            electronic devices, and is ubiquitous in modern electronic systems."

        However, as one would imagine, if you try to pack more and more
        transistors in a smaller area, it will be exponentially more costly, and
        there will be issues with heat, as well as limits faced with the laws of
        physics.

        Update: the F-2017 edition (after the class break) brought up a graph
        from David Patterson's textbook, showing that serial processor
        performance was exponential up to the last decade, to which it
        flat-lined. 
        
        - Thus, in the "glory days" you could write a program and expect newer
          hardware to just be faster. But not anymore. If we tried to cram
          things even further, we'd run into programs like quantum computers,
          where we don't know if things are really a 0 or a 1 anymore. Uh oh.

        - Now companies (e.g. Apple, Tesla, Samsung, Google, Microsoft) are not
          just buying general-purpose Intel chips, but building their own chips.
          So it's an exciting time to be a computer architect.

    Principles of Locality (memory hierarchy and caches!!)

        Jim Gray's storage latency analogy. I've seen this one before. It's
        really nice. Everyone has a nice joke to play about caches. Main thing
        to know is what is actually in the hierarchy:
            - Registers
            - On-chip cache
            - On-board cache
            - Main memory (i.e. RAM)
            - Hard disk
            - Tape and optical robot (not sure what this means)
        Also see the pyramid in the notes. It makes sense: the stuff "closer" to
        us in the hierarchy just listed above has to be smaller since there's
        less room. Thus, registers are cramped in a small space and are limited,
        but there's much more room for memory on the hard disk. 
        
        It seems like we have three main caches: L1, L2, and L3. Not sure on the
        difference between on-chip vs on-board cache, though. That might be
        on-chip (as in on the CPU?) vs on the MOTHERboard. As I (finally!!) now
        know from experience, the CPU chip goes in the motherboard in a very
        specific spot.

    Parallelism (CS 267!!)
        
        This is another thing we should do if possible. We can "fork" calls into
        several "workers" and then "join" them together later. Professor Katz
        mentions the laundry example. He can use the wash. Then the dryer. But
        if he's using the dryer, there's no reason why someone can't use the
        wash. So this is like stacking things together in a tree-fashion, might
        be related to "tricks with trees" from CS 267.

            Also: we'll learn how to do thread programming, using fork() to
            split up computation into worker threads, and join() calls to
            combine the result.

        Caveat: Amdahl's law. It tries to predict speed-ups from parallelism.
        The law states the obvious: if there are parts of an application which
        cannot be parallelized, then we can't get "perfect" speedup, which
        hypothetically would be a 2x speedup if we had 2x parallelism.

    Dependency via Reproducibility (should be obvious!)

        The larger our system, the more likely we have individual components 
        that fail. But when we program, we desperately want to make sure we can
        focus on debugging what WE wrote, and NOT the underlying hardware (oh
        God).

        Easiest thing to do: take majority vote, this helps to protect against
        faulty machines. Prof Katz: this seems silly and expensive, but useful
        if we have to send code in space or some other area where it's too
        expensive to send repairmen.
            
        Redundant memory bits as well; these are Error Correcting Codes (ECCs).
        Can also do calculations involving the parity of a number (odd vs even)
        so we have a spare piece of memory which corrects the expected parity as
        needed. 


Then we switched speakers to Prof. Krste Asanović.

    Higher-level stuff:

        Moore's Law, etc., showed a new paradigm for computer architecture.  See
        my earlier comments on Moore's Law.
        
        Then Deep Learning. Yes, I knew it! That's why Deep Learning needs
        computer architects, because it's now the hardware and not the algorithm
        (After all, we're still doing backpropagation). 
        
        Google has developed a "Tensor Processing Unit" (TPU), a specialized
        engine for NN training. Interesting ... I saw Jeff Dean talking about
        this recently in his AMA.

        Microsoft has developed "Microsoft Brain Wave". Gah, so many new
        developments.

    RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

        In F-2017, they are switching to this from MIPS, which was used in
        previous iterations of the course. It was designed at Berkeley for
        research and education.

        ISA = the language of the processor, or how software is encoded to run
        on hardware. Example: think about how an "add" instruction would be
        written in bits.

        Why are we using it if it's open source? Because the cool people are
        adopting it. Starting now, NVIDIA is using RISC-V in their GPUs. And the
        previous popular set, MIPS, is not doing so well; the company that owns
        it is apparently up for sale?


(Then we switched back to Prof. Katz, and had some stuff about class
administration.  Yeah, I won't post any homeworks publicly, they'll be private.)


Everything is Just a Number

    Computers represent data as binary values.
        - The *bit* is the unit element, either 0 or 1. We're not doing quantum
          computing in this class, so we _know_ for certain if a bit is zero or
          one.
        - Then *bytes* are eight bits, can represent 2^8 = 256 different values.
        - A "word" is 4 bytes (i.e. 32 bits), has 2^32 different values, like Java
            integers.
        - Then there are 64-bit floating point numbers (and 32-bit as well),
          numpy can express both though the Theano library encourages 32-bit.
        - All of these are built up into longer and more complicated expressions!
        - In F-2017, we'll learn how RISC-V encodes computer programs into bits.

    Be sure to MEMORIZE how to convert: (binary <==> decimal). This is so
    important to have down cold. I'm definitely intuitively better at going in
    the ==> direction, just write the number then underneath, going in REVERSE
    direction, do 2^0, 2^1, etc., then multiply by 1s and 0s and add up. Other
    direction: keep successively dividing by two (rounding down) and keep track
    of parities. Collect (not sum!) the results together at the end.

    Unfortunately, there's also the hexadecimal notation. That's harder. Now
    there are 16 different units, not 2 or 10. It goes from 0 to 9 and then we
    note it as A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, F=15. Obviously, I wrote the
    decimal numbers afterwards, could have easily done the binary version.
        - There are also octals, with 8 units of computation. 
        - I'll avoid using these whenever possible.

    Make sure to be consistent with putting down "two", "ten", or "hex" as
    subscripts after the numbers. It will make it easier to track which is
    which.

    How to use these numbers in C?
        Use %d for decimal (I know this now!)
        Use %x for hexadecimal
        Use %o for octal
    Might also have to write numbers with 0x[...] and 0b[...] with 0x or 0b
    prefix to indicate which representation we're using.

    Beyond bytes, we have kilobytes, gigabytes, etc. Notice that marketing will
    assume we multiply by 1000, i.e. kilobytes are 1000 bytes. But in reality we
    "should" have 1024 bytes per kilobytes. Marketing can get away with not
    including that extra 24. Grrr. For the binary system, we use an extra "i",
    so it's KiByte, instead of KByte. And 1GB = 1000MB and 1GiB = 1024MiB.
    Watch out!


**************************************
* Lecture 2: Numbers and C Language  *
* Given: August 29, 2017             *
**************************************

Signed integer representation (Note: this material was originally in the first
lecture in F-2016, but got bumped to the second lecture in F-2017 to make room
for more discussion on why we need computer architects, and also Deep Learning.)

    We need to have negative numbers, so how to handle these?

    First attempt: first digit (well, leading digit, so leftmost) represents
        sign, remaining 7 (assuming 8 bits total) are for actual numerical
        content, "magnitude". But that's bad --- at least for integers --- since
        we have several special cases to consider, and our hardware performance
        will suffer.

    Better: two's complement. With 4 bits, have 16 total numbers:
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15
                        -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 

    Thus, -3 in decimal maps to 13 in binary. This allows us to keep
    adding/subtraction rules for binary numbers consistent. Right, this is
    StackOverflow: "Two's complement is a clever way of storing integers so that
    common math problems are very simple to implement." In other words, the
    hardware doesn't have to make any special rules.

        But remember that these are just bits. Regardless of signed or unsigned,
        it's bits (four, in this case) that the hardware sees.

        A good analogy with alarm clocks in the lecture, particularly because my
        alarm clock requires me to keep incrementing the time before it "starts
        over" at the current value. Thus, 3+11=14 in unsigned, but this is
        3-5=-2 in two's complement. Fortunately, the "adder" doesn't care, it
        just does the addition the same way, and we interpret it under the
        assumption that it's two's complement.

        It's not a "sign+magnitude" representation, because the second part
        isn't a "magnitude".

    How to do negation in two's complement: INVERT the bits, then add one.
    Don't forget to add one.
    
    The most significant bit (MSB) also indicates the sign, as in our first
    representation, but doesn't have the drawback of painful math or a +0 and -0
    annoyance as in the signed integer representation.

    With two's complement, **if signs are different**, no overflow detection
    needed. This makes sense, you can't add a positive and a negative number and
    get something exceeding your range, that's like a shrinkage factor.

    Adding numbers of different bit widths:
        - Unsigned: simply pad zeros at the most significant bits.
        - Signed: **sign extension**, pad either all 0s or all 1s, depending on
          the current sign of the number.


Break / This is Not on the Exam

    Prof. Asanović talked about Google's TPU. :-) My God, it's so impressive. It
    has an **internal** matrix multiply unit. Ironically, it's useless for
    everything **except** for matrix multiplies. Then he talked about the IBM
    Mainframe.


C Primer

    Remember, we're not giving a tutorial on C, the class is about the
    hardware/software interface.

    Bla bla bla hello world. Use printf("") for printing. Don't forget \n
    newlines!! Think of System.out.print("") in Java (not the println version).
    Also don't forget semicolons. And `#include <stdio.h>`. They use `int
    main(void)` whereas I use `int main()` but there's no difference in C++ and
    in C the difference is "questionable". I think it doesn't matter for what I
    would use. But use int main(void) instead, to clearly specify that the
    method doesn't take in any arguments (according to StackOverflow).

    Then compiling using `gcc program.c ; ./a.out`.

    Progression:
        [...].c --(compiler)--> [...].o --(linker)--> [a.out]
    From source (i.e. text) file to "machine code object files" (whatever those
    are) to actual executable files, what gets run. The linker makes use of
    other library files, if we're using them, such as stdio.h I think. And the
    linker helps to link a bunch of [...].c files that we wrote, since we should
    split up our C code in several files to stay sane.

        There's *also* a "pre-processor" before the compiler executes, which (1)
        converts comments to a single space and (2) takes care of logic related
        to commands that start with #. These are "macros" and get expanded to
        replace their stuff inline, so for instance, if I look at the
        intermediate file output from Hello World, it could be very long. But
        that's OK, it's how C works. :-)

    Different from interpreted languages, such as Python, which are run
    "line-by-line". 

    More similar to Java, but Java converts to "byte code" which is an EXAMPLE
    of an assembly language.

    Advantages:
        - Faster. This is why numpy uses a C/C++ "back end"; more on that later
          once I better understand it.
        - Note that computers can only "run" machine code, or the lowest-level
          instructions that it can run. Everything else is one layer of
          abstraction upon abstraction. Compilation can get our C code to
          machine code in "one shot".

    Disadvantages:
        - Long time to compile.
        - Need tools like "make" to avoid compiling unchanged code. OK maybe
          this isn't a real disadvantage, since we should be using make by
          default.
        - Architecture- and operating systems-specific.

C Type Declarations

    Examples:
        int a;
        float b;
        char c;
    Like Java, have to declare beforehand, and the type can't change.
    (Usually, floats are 32 bits and doubles are 64 bits.)

    Can do:
        float pi = 3.14; /* ok this is mathematically awful but w/e */
    But probably better to have it as a constant:
        const float pi = 3.14;

    For 'unsigned' stuff, just put that before the type, e.g. 'unsigned long'.

    Enumerations:
        typedef enum {red, green, blue} Color;
    We can then write and call `switch` on:
        Color pants = green; /* to use one example ... */

    AH, now it's clear, in Java we KNOW ints are 32 bits, but in C it could be
    16, 32, or 64 bits. Though on my system it's 32 and I think that makes the
    most sense.
        To check, use sizeof(int) and print it. I get '4' which must mean the
        BYTE count.

    No boolean data types! I learned this the hard way. (That's in C++).
    0=False, anything else is true (but I guess use 1 for convention).

    Standard function definitions, like Java. But it looks like we don't need to
    use 'public...' or 'public static...'. 

    Uninitialized variables: if you don't define them, they take on a random
    value in memory, i.e. garbage. Their for loop example prints different
    values of (uninitialized) x because they have another function which messes
    around with the memory on the stack. I think if that wasn't there, you would
    get the same "garbage" value for x. [Update: heh, a student asked the same
    question. But the Prof. said we should not rely on that. Which is fine, this
    was only a theoretical question.]

    structs:
        - Groups of variables
        - Like Java classes, but no methods
        - one-liner example syntax:
            typedef struct {int x, y;} Point;
        - then to create one:
            Point p = { 77, -8 };

Concluding Thoughts

    NO CLASSES in C! You need C++ for that, according to my own experience, and
    StackOverflow. For a while, C++ was known as "C with classes". But now it's
    just bloated. In C, simulate some class functionality by using structs.
    Thus, C shouldn't qualify as "object-oriented".

    Other main programmatic difference from Java (first one being no classes) is
    that in C we have explicit pointers. Let's discuss that in the next lecture.

    There are additional differences in the compilation, obviously.


TODO BELOW ... (for F-2017)

****************************
* Lecture 3: Pointers      *
* Given: September 1, 2016 *
****************************

Pointers in C

    Processor vs Memory in computer, two different components.
        Former has registers, ALU, etc.
        Latter contains various bytes that form the programs, data, etc.

    Don't confuse memory address and a value. It's like humans are the 'values'
    living in their homes as 'memory addresses'. A POINTER is a MEMORY ADDRESS.
        When we say int a; then a = -85;, the memory address is some unknown
        integer and the value is -85.

    Know differences:
        int *x;         // variable x is an address to an int
        int y = 9;      // y is an int with value 9
        x = &y;         // assigns *address of* (almost certainly not 9) y to x
        int z = *x;     // assigns *value of* x (should be 9) to z
        *x = -7;        // Assigns -7 to what x is pointing at

    Interesting, I get x=1505581164 y=-7 z=9 as the printf output, so when we
    set the memory address of y to x, and modify what x is pointing at, that
    will *also* modify what y points at. Interesting ... and a bit of a pain to
    track.

    Another thing, the type of x is 'int*', NOT 'int'. Watch out! It might be
    helpful to visualize this the way CS 61C does with its charts. Can write
    int* pi; or int *pi;, seems like the class does it the latter. It's
    unambiguous especially for char *a,*b; vs char* a,b;, in which case that 'b'
    is NOT a pointer to a char.

        Use generic pointers for applications such as allocating or freeing
        memory, where the code may need to point to arbitrary stuff.

        Have pointers to structs as well, which is where we get the arrow syntax
        "->" that I've seen before.

        Another trick: *(&a) = a, I believe.

    One thing, if we do '*pa = 5', this is NOT assigning to 'pa' but rather
    '*pa'. It doesn't really make sense to assign directly to 'pa' unless we
    know a memory address. Do we really want to gamble that '5' is indeed the
    correct _memory_address_ and not _value_?

    Functions
        These have pointers too. For arguments:
            void foo(int x, int *p) { ... }
        To call it, use:
            foo(a, &b);
        where a and b are both ints. The 'b' will get "passed by reference",
        since the pointer is passed by value. So it's like Java. There are a ton
        of blogs about this online.

        PS: I really like their four-column table approach, really helps

Arrays in C (syntactic sugar for pointers, really)

    Several ways to declare basic arrays:
        int a[5]; // five integer array, obviously, but contents are garbage
        int b = {1,2,3}; // explicitly assign elements, not garbage =)

    In memory diagram: form contiguous block of memory, index 0 at bottom, then
    proceeding up we increment indices. 

    #1 way we can shoot ourselves in the foot: no array bounds checking.
        So remember array sizes, e.g. by using:
            const int ARRAY_SIZE = 10;
        and then using that ARRAY_SIZE throughout the program. Don't repeat
        yourself!

        Helpful to also use sizeof() operator to get number of bytes. I use this
        frequently. But we can't assume anything about the hardware, other than
        sizeof(char) == 1. Don't assume: use sizeof(...) instead!

Pointer Arithmetic

    PS: for computers, use byte addresses, so think of memory for an int as
    taking up four slots, because (at least in one example and on my machine) C
    ints are 4 bytes.

    I see, we can do stuff like:
        char c[] = {'a','b'};
        char *pc = c; // from webcast, also same as &(c[0])
    so pc is now a char* type, and *pc = 'a'. If we do *pc++; then pc = 'b'. The
    POINTER is incremented, not the value pointed by it. Yeah, it's confusing,
    this time we actually want to manipulate the address.

    The array name is a pointer to the 0th element of the "array".
        char *pstr;
        char astr[];
    are identical except we can do pstr++ while we can't do astr++.
        ALSO: astr[2] = *(astr+2)

    OH I see, when we do pc++ the compiler actually adds sizeof(...) and takes
    care of that logic for us; it doesn't really "add one". Thanks!

    Bad style to interchange arrays and pointers.

    For methods, you can define them in the following ways:
        foo(int[] array, unsigned int size);
        foo(int *array, unsigned int size);

    Be careful when doing sizeof(a) with 'a' an array, because that might
    represent a pointer, which is usually 8 bytes on modern 64-bit machines. But
    if you start with int a[40] and do sizeof(a) you actually get
    10*sizeof(int), that's weird.

    No sense to do so and is also illegal, don't do the following:
        - Add two pointers
        - Multiply two pointers
        - Subtracting a pointer from an integer
    We CAN, however, compare pointers to NULL, for instance (keyword might be
    'null' in C).

    Pointers to pointers also exist. Oh no.

Strings and Main

    C strings are "null terminated character arrays":
        char s[] = 'abc';
    To find the length, iterate through the string and increment an index.
    Detect end of string with '0' or whatever special character we have.

    Don't forget the alternative way of writing main() methods with arguments:
        int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {...}
    argv is a POINTER ... (of type char*) ... TO AN ARRAY (that contains the
    string arguments from the command line). The argc is simply the number of
    arguments.

        When we run ./a.out, the './a.out' part is argv[0], other arguments
        after that go in later components, in order. It's similar to Python.

Concluding Remarks

    Pointers are the same as (machine) memory addresses.
    Except for void*, pointers know the type and size of the objects they point
        to (is this why sizeof(a) for 'int a[10]' is known? Not sure).
    Pointers are powerful, but dangerous without careful planning.
