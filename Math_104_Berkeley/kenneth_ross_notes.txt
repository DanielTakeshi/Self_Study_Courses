I skimmed this chapter and I should know just about everything from it. It
includes:

- Natural numbers

- Simple induction

- Rational numbers (also the definition of an "algebraic number")

- The "Rational Zeros" theorem, which might be useful if I need to find
  candidates for solving certain polynomial equations. This can also be used to
  prove that sqrt(2) is not a rational number, and several other numbers, mostly
  by doing some brute-force cases for checking all possible solutions. It's a
  bit boring to do that! Note: this theorem only applies to finding *rational*
  zeros of polynomials with *integer* coefficients. For a more general rule, use
  "Newton's method" or the "secant method."

- The set of real numbers. Now we're getting into real stuff here! We also have
  the triangle inequality, blah blah blah ...

- The Completeness Axiom. This is the assertion that "\mathbb{R} has no gaps"
  and is the key factor which distinguishes \mathbb{R} from \mathbb{Q}. (It's
  discussed in Section 4.4.) Among other things, this section discusses:

    - The concepts of a minimum, maximum, and slightly more non-trivially, those
      of an _infinum_ (greatest lower bound) and _supremum_ (least upper bound).
      For the latter two, I know clearly that sup S and inf S do not have to
      belong to S! Classic example: (a,b). I remember doing examples like these
      from MATH 305 at Williams College: basically, finding the infimums and
      supremums of sets. It's nothing too fancy. Man, I must have been a bad
      student back then!

    - The concepts of upper bounds, lower bounds, etc.

    - The completeness axiom (as I mentioned). This does _not_ hold for the
      rationals!

  Yeah, nothing too advanced here. I'm happy that at least this material is easy
  for me to understand and review.

- The symbols +infinity and -infinity, which are useful but must be handled with
  care. Do not treat them as real numbers that can be plugged into theorems!
  Note that it is also discussed that for nonempty, _bounded_ subsets A and B of
  \mathbb{R}, sup(A + B) = sup A + sup B and the same relation for infimums.
  This might be useful in some statistics proofs if we are dealing with multiple
  sets.
   
    - Useful to define sup S = +infinity if S is not bounded above, etc.

- The last section is a "Development of \mathbb{R}" and it's probably not that
  useful for me.
