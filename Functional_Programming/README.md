This is the Coursera course on Functional Programming, taught by the person who
created the Scala Programming Language. =)

It says it's from January 30 to March 9; the year isn't stated but I assume it's
2017, which means this could be the first Coursera course that I actually follow
from start to finish in time. I hope.
