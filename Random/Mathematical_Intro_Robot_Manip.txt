***************************
* Chapter 1: Introduction *
***************************

Some history here ... not that relevant to me at this moment. I'd like to see a
more modern take on this.

But I do like this:

> The vast majority of robots in operation today consist of six joints which are
> either rotary (articulated) or sliding (prismatic), with a simple "end-
> effector" for interacting with the workpieces.

Yes, the dvrk has one "prismatic" joint out of seven (note, seven, not six...)
and the others are rotary --- the dvrk guide actually says "revolute". And I
obviously know the end-effectors by now.

Then they talk about the book outline. Yeah, maybe I'll definitely take a look
at Chapter 2 at a "leisurely pace" to better understand rigid body motion:

> In this chapter, we present a geometric view to understanding translational
> and rotational motion of a rigid body. While this is one of the most
> ubiquitous topics encountered in textbooks on mechanics and robotics, it is
> also perhaps one of the most frequently misunderstood.

OK, fair enough.

Important facts:

- Location (x, y, z).
- Trajectory (x(t), y(t), z(t)) = p(t).
- Rigid **body** satisfies || p(t) - q(t) || =  || p(0) - q(0) || = constant.
- Rigid body transformation: map from R^3 -> R^3 representing "rigid motion"
  (subtle point: cross product must be preserved).

- Know **rotation matrices**: orthogonal and has determinant 1 if right handed
  coordinate frame.
- SO(n) = "Special Orthogonal" group of (n,n) matrices, typically n=3 but
  sometimes n=2. These are a linear algebra "group" under matrix multiplication;
  definition is the same as the abstract algebra concept.

- Special Exponential

...

Other major points:

- To track motion of a rigid body, we just need to watch one point plus the
  rotation w.r.t. that point. Hence, use a *configuration* which means we
  "attach" a coordinate frame to a point and track it w.r.t. a fixed frame.
  Don't forget what we mean by a configuration: something which can tell us
  "complete" (or "sufficient"?) information about something in some space. I
  remember that from CS 294-115.
