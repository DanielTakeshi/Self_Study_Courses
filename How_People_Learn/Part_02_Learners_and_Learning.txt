Part 2: Learners and Learning


Chapter 2: How Experts Differ from Novices

Very important:

- As implied in the previous chapter, what distinguishes experts from novices
  isn't necessarily factual knowledge (nor is it ability or intelligence), more
  as it is about better connections among concepts, and the ability to
  "conditionalize" knowledge.  This means being able to know what areas/concepts
  are needed for a specific task, rather than trying our everything.
  
- (Related) Experts have more fluent knowledge retrieval, so they better know
  what applies to specific tasks. This means their memory is not taxed trying to
  figure out what would apply. Organization is more efficient; novices may
  retrieve knowledge in a slow, sequential manner.

- Experts recognize (and are more sensitive to) meaningful patterns across many
  fields. Example: with chess, if you randomize the pieces, the experts don't
  really remember those locations any better than novices, but if the pieces are
  arranged as they might be in a real game situation, the expert can pick up
  patterns and remember the location of pieces far better than novices can. 
  
- Different styles of experts: "artisans" vs "virtuosos". The former are experts
  in one field but the latter are also experts and, moreover, have the desirable
  property of "active learning" so they are experts at learning about new
  things. This requires metacognition, as discussed in the first chapter.
  Educational programs need to be designed to encourage the development of
  virtuosos.

Also important:

- Cool example with physics: experts organize problems in a way that reflects
  deeper, fundamental ideas, whereas novices will organize problems if they look
  similar (e.g., have the same drawings of triangles).

- Being an expert at a subject is NOT the same as being an expert at teaching.
  An expert teacher will better understand when students might get stuck. Yeah,
  this is a widely agreed-upon fact.
